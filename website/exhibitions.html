      <p1>
        <h4>STUART RICHARDS - Milk & Honey</h4>
        <h5>January 15 - March 2, 2016</h5>
        Kale Gallery is pleased to present a solo exhibition of photographer
        Stuart Richards. Milk & Honey examines the complex architecture of bird
        nests, constructed from elements of the natural world and debris
        discarded by humans. The nests are intricate structures, unique in shape and form.

        <h4>LAURY BARNES - The Peace</h4>
        <h5>April 30 - June 8, 2016</h5>
        Kale Gallery is delighted to present The Peace, photographer Laury
        Barnes' five-year study of Central Park. This is the first time a
        selection of these photographs will be seen by the public. It is also
        her New York City debut.

        <h4>JASON FENCE - Harbor</h4>
        <h5>July 17 - August 9, 2016</h5>
        Kale Gallery is delighted to debut a series of new drawings by artist
        Jason Fence. His additive drawing process allows an on-going pattern to
        form. Each new color introduces another simple layer creating the
        complex overall arrangement. He is often inspired by domestic design
        sources and carpet patterns.

        <h4>LISA HOLT - Real People</h4>
        <h5>July 17 - August 9, 2016</h5>
        Kale Gallery is delighted to present a series of photographs by tintype
        artist Lisa Holt. As urbanization continues to become more prevalent in
        America, history and growth of rural identity and culture become
        fleeting and near forgotten. Since 2010, Holt has been creating tintypes
        of traditional folk musicians who live in and around the Appalachian
        Mountains.
